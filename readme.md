## Multi-Lingual Sexist Hate Speech Detection and Classification

##### Our Project is divided into 8 files. Following are the files with the description of what it contains:
- **IRE_project_XLM_R.ipynb:** Contains XLM-R model code and results
- **IRE_project_ROBERTA.ipynb:** Contains Roberta model code and results
- **IRE_Project_Multilinguial_BERT.ipynb:** Contains Multilinguial BERT model code and results
- **BERT_and_BETO.ipynb :** Contains BERT and BETO models codes and results
- **Bertweet.ipynb:** Contains Bertweet model code and results
- **Exist_Data_Augmentation.ipynb:** Contains code for data augmentation and stored results on drive
- **Augmented_BERT_&_BETO.ipynb:** Contains BERT and BETO models trained on augmented data codes and results
- **IRE_PROJECT_Class_Balanced_BERT_&_BETO.ipynb:** Contains BERT and BETO models trained on class balanced data codes and results

##### Steps to Run
- Create a folder named `SEXISM DATA` on your google drive
- Upload the 2 train and test files in this folder
- Now run each of the above 8 code files independently from colab.
- Run all cells of each file in sequence.
- This will fetch the results.

##### Results
All results are in the report as well as the individual results for each model are in their respective python notebooks file also.
